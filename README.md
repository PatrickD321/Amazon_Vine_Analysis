# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The objective of this challenge is demonstrate the ablity intereact in big data file that is not stored on your personal device, that is data stored on a large server such as AWS.
Since the data is very large, it can be handled by spliting up work between team member by using MapReduce. 
- Mapping - processing input and producing small chunks of data across each computer
- Reducing, which is when you come back together to combine the results. 
This is an efficent way analysing big data using Hadoop which is an ecosystem for handling big data. With the growing intrest in big data and cloud computing a more robust and flexible form of data processing is required and Apache Spark a unified analytical engine similar to that of Python is avaiable. We will use this in this challenge to get data from big data storage facilities such as Netflix or Amazon to both move process and analyzed very large files.
